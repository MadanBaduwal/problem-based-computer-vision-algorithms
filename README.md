# Typical tasks
## Recognition
Determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity.

### Object recognition (also called object classification) 
one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene. Blippar, Google Goggles and LikeThat provide stand-alone programs that illustrate this functionality.
